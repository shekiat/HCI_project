Create a browser plugin that allows users to input specific allergies (e.g., metal, nut, ammonia, parabens in perfume) and automatically filters and flags products on various websites like Walmart and Sephora. This tool helps users easily identify and avoid products that may contain allergens, enhancing their shopping experience and ensuring safety in areas like jewelry, food, cleaning products, and beauty items.
